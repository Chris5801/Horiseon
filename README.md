I know we were looking for more than just one push to commit, but I ran into quite a few issues. 
Originally, I wss under the impression that I would clone the repo and make my changes. After hours of googling how to fork a repo or just save it as my own, a wonderful TA informed me I was just supposed to copy it into my own repo. 
I have readjusted as much of the VS code as possible to go along with my new links, but I'm afraid Ive run out of time.
